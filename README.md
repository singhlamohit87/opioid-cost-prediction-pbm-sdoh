## Overview
This repository accompanies the paper *"Predicting Opioid Cost Burden through Integrated PBM and SDOH Modeling: An Explainable AI Framework."*  
It contains example data structures, feature-engineering logic, model pipeline descriptions, and visualization scripts for reproducibility.

## Contents
- `/notebooks/` – Jupyter notebooks for feature engineering, modeling, and simulation  
- `/figures/` – Key figures used in the manuscript (R² plots, SHAP charts, etc.)  
- `/data/` – Sample synthetic datasets (no PHI)  
- `/docs/` – Paper PDF and supplementary materials
